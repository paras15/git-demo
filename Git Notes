You can start git in two ways:
1- local 2- remote

to start local, one have to initialize current working directory using "git init"
to start remote, set up a git repository on remote, then use "git clone" to create a new repository on our local system

Working Directory - git init -> work
Staging Area - git add (git track the files in staging area/index area)
Git Repository - git commit
Remote(Github/Gitlab/BitBucket)

push - Move changes from git repository to remote
pull - Move changes from remote to Working Directory

to download git in windows:
- Go to "git-for-windows.github.io"
- Download the installer as per your OS configuration

Basic git commands:

To grow, mark and tweak your common history
branch                  List, create, or delete branches
commit                  Record changes to the repository
merge                   Join two or more development histories together
rebase                  Reapply commits on top of another base tip
reset                   Reset current HEAD to the specified state
switch                  Switch branches
tag                     Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
fetch                   Download objects and refs from another repository
pull                    Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
push                    Update remote refs along with associated objects

To backout changes
restore --staged <file> To unstage (To move file back from staging area to working directory)
restore <file>          To discard changes in working directory

rm <file>
commit                  To remove file from git repository (Use both of these)

mv <file> <path>        To move file to another place
commit                  To commit latest file to git repository

Others
status                  Shows which files have been modified in the working directory vs Git's staging area
log                     To see commits in git repository
log --oneline --graph   To see commits in short in git repository
help <command name>     To find out command working

.gitignore              Add file regex expression in .gitignore file if you don't want to commit them to git repository
commits                 To add updated .gitignore to git repository

To store and list git credentials
git config --global user.name "paras maheshwari"
git config --global user.email "paras.maheshwari@gmail.com"
git config --global --list

To generate and connect gitHub using ssh key:
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email"  (Use your actual email address in the example)
In github - Go to settings - SSH and GPG keys - copy and paste id_rsa.pub key
ssh -T git@github.com (This command uses ssh to connect to GitHub over the SSH protocol)

To create a new repository on the command line:
echo "# git-demo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:paras15/git-demo.git
git push -u origin main

To push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin git@github.com:paras15/git-demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
